**HTML Introduction**
--


 What is HTML ?<br>
HTML [HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE] is language for Specifying how text and graphics appear on the webpage<br>



**Your First Webpage**<br>
Open your favourate Text editor and type<br>

```
Hello World
```
and save it as _helloWorld**.html**_<br>
Dont forget the .html extension

and open the Doument with firefox or chrome. it will display something like This ![helloWorld Output](docImages/helloWorld.png)

Well.. eventhough browser able to render it without proper markup<br>
Before moving on we need to understand how browser understand input file<br>
go to the developer console by **pressing F12** then you can see something like This ![helloWorld Debug Console](docImages/helloWorldF12.png)

if you see clearly you can see that.. eventhough you didnt added any markup...<br>
Web browser addded it for you.. it is quite forgiving sometimes....

****

**Simple HTML Document**

**** So.. the proper form of html Document is



```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello World
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you are wondering what are those weird angular brackets with names in it..

from MDN

> HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language, >and is used to tell your browser how to display the webpages you visit HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way

If to Explain:

```
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    The <head> element contains meta information about the document
    The <body> element contains the visible page content
and The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
```

so whatever we wanted to display in the **webpage** we need to put into the **body element**. And whatever the browser required to _understand our webpage_ it goes to the _Head Element_.

By the End of Workshop we are going to created three Three Webpages those are

![IndexPage](docImages/index.png)

page 1 : Index Page

<br>
![loginPage](docImages/loginPage.png)

page 2 : Login Page

<br>
![testPage](docImages/testPage.png)

page 3 : Test Page

<br>
Ok.. We are gonna Implement them Step by Step<br>
So If we look at the Index Page<br>
In the webpage some text is displaying.. so lets modify the helloworld example to disply the first two lines.
```html
<!-- ex1.html -->
<html>
  <head>
 </head>
 <body>
   Online Examination
   This is a simple online Examination interface Developed By Kunchala Anil Working in KSRM College Of Engineering as a part of the HTML Workshop on 7 Dec 2016.
 </body>
```
  The output is ![ex1.html output](docImages/ex1.png)

In the display there are two things to be fixed

1. we wanted a heading in the page
2. Heading has to be separated from below text
------------------

**Headings in HTML**
--
<p>Headings are defined with the *&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h1&gt; tags*

There are six heading elements â€” *&lt;h1&gt;, *&lt;h2&gt;, <*&lt;h3&gt;, *&lt;h4&gt;, *&lt;h5&gt;, and *&lt;h6&gt;. Each element represents a different level of content in the document;<br><br>

&lt;h1&gt; represents the main heading, <br>
&lt;h2&gt;represents subheadings, <br>
&lt;h3&gt;represents sub-subheadings, and so on.
 </p>

 so update our code to display heading

 ```html
 <!-- ex2.html -->
 <!doctype html>
 <html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Online Examination</h1>
    This is a simple online Examination interface Developed By Kunchala Anil Working in KSRM College Of Engineering as a part of the HTML Workshop on 7 Dec 2016
  </body>
 </html>
```
save it as ex2.html and open it with webbrowser. you will get

![ex2 Ouptut](docImages/ex2.png)





 The HTML &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph

<p>With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed </p>

so if we want to display them separatly we can we use p tag with as a element.
